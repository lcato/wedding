## Kanya Dhanam

Liam’s family gifts Janani a special 9-yard saree, a garment worn only by married women, in preparation for the upcoming marriage ceremony.

## Mangalya Dharanam: Tying the Knot

Liam ties the ‘mangalsutra’, or wedding necklace (a gold ‘thali’ (pendant) on a sacred yellow thread), around Janani’s neck and secures it with 3 knots.

## Panigrahanam: Holding Hands

As a married couple, Janani and Liam hold hands and walk around the sacred fire 4 times while chanting prayers in Sanskrit praying for a long and prosperous life together. Liam leads the first two, while Janani leads the second two rounds, symbolizing both partner’s duty to lead the couple at different time in life. The four rounds represent the 4 essential aspects of a full life according to Hindu scripture: Dharma (Duty), Artha (Wealth), Kama (Desire), and Moksha (Liberation)

## Saptapadi: The 7 Steps

Janani and Liam take the 7 sacred steps around the fire together while chanting a special prayer to Lord Vishnu with each step. First for nourishment, second for physical, mental, and spiritual strength to support each other, third to do good and serve others, fourth for harmony and happiness, fifth to preserve wealth, sixth for good fortune in all seasons of life, and the seventh to live spiritually. After, the couple chants a series of vows summarized as follows:

 "With the seven steps that we have taken together, you are now my greatest friend. I will never leave this bond. We have been brought together by God and we shall live together with love and goodness in our hearts. Just as words and lyrics, Earth and Heaven, matter and energy, mind and words, and word and its meaning cannot be separated, so shall we be. Let us pray for wealth, children, and happy and fulfilling life." The couple is now spiritually married.
