# Wedding

## Ganesh Pooja
Prayers and offerings to Lord Ganesha to mark an auspicious start to the wedding

## Kashi Yatra: Pilgrimage to Kashi
Liam, dressed in simple clothing, begins a pilgrimage to the holy city of Kashi to pursue an ascetic life focused on education and spiritual enlightenment. Along the way, he learns of the joys of marriage from Janani's father and chooses to stay and pursue lifelong partnership and a family. 

## Maalai Maatral: Garland Exchange
Lifted on the shoulders of their uncles and loved ones, Janani and Liam exchange 3 sets of garlands

## Oonjal: Swing Ceremony
Together, Janani and Liam sit on a decorated swing, symbolizing their promise to meet the ups and downs of life together as partners. Married women from both sides of the family sing, feed the couple sweet milk, and bestow blessings onto the couple

## Kanya Dhanam
Janani’s parents honor the choice of their child’s future partner, symbolically giving their daughter away and joyfully receiving their new son, the greatest gift a family can give and receive. The parents chant prayers and the names of three generations on both sides to solemnize and invoke the blessings of ancestors for the marriage and so that God will bless the couple with a life full of sweetness, health, and prosperity. Janani will change into a 9-yard saree, a garment worn only by married women, in preparation for the upcoming marriage ceremony. This saree will be in the traditional dark red and green colors. In the meantime, the priest will start the sacred fire ‘Agni’ for the ‘homam’ (fire-based ceremony)

## Muhurtham & Mangalya Dharanam: Tying the Knot
Liam ties the ‘mangalsutra’ (wedding necklace) which includes the gold ‘thali’ (pendant) on a sacred yellow thread around Janani’s neck and secures it with 3 knots. The tying of these knots symbolizes the unification of their minds, hearts, and souls. As the necklace is tied, notice the music change, signifying the defining moment of the couple as married! At this time guest may throw flower petals on the couple.

## Vows and Rings
Immediately following the Mangalya Dharanam, Janani and Liam will exchange their wedding vows and their wedding bands

## Panigrahanam: Holding Hands
Now as a married couple, Janani and Liam hold hands and Liam prays for spiritual companionship and promises to Janani to always be there by her side

## Saptapadi: The 7 Steps
Janani and Liam take the 7 sacred steps around the fire together while chanting a special prayer to Lord Vishnu with each step. First for nourishment, second for physical, mental, and spiritual strength to support each other, third to do good and serve others, fourth for harmony and happiness, fifth to preserve wealth, sixth for good fortune in all seasons of life, and the seventh to live spiritually. Afterwards, the couple chants a series of vows summarized as follows: "With the seven steps that we have taken together, you are now my greatest friend. I will never leave this bond. We have been brought together by God and we shall live together with love and goodness in our hearts. Just as words and lyrics, Earth and Heaven, matter and energy, mind and words, and word and its meaning cannot be separated, so shall we be. Let us pray for wealth, children, and happy and fulfilling life." The couple is now spiritually married.

## Pradhaana Homam
The just-married couple then pays homage to ‘Agni’, the God of Fire. The bride and groom place ghee and the twigs of nine types of trees into the sacred fire. The fumes that arise are supposed to possess medicinal, curative, and cleansing effects for the couple.

## Laja Homam 
The bride’s brothers give the bride a handful of parched rice. She hands this to the groom who places it into the fire. This ritual occurs three times. Through this offering, the couple prays for a long life for their new family. The couple then circles around the fire 4 times. Liam leads the first two, while Janani leads the second two rounds, symbolizing both partner’s duty to lead the couple at different times in life. The four rounds represent the 4 essential aspects of a full life according to Hindu scripture: Dharma (Duty), Artha (Wealth), Kama (Desire), and Moksha (Liberation). 

## Metti Dharanam: Treading the Grindstone
Holding the bride's left toe, the groom helps her tread on a grindstone kept on the right side of the fire. The groom then places the bride's right foot on the grindstone, symbolizing a solid foundation of marriage. The bride's aunt places toe rings on the bride's second toes, another symbol of a married Hindu woman.

## Aashirvaadam
The bride and groom touch the feet of their parents and elders of the
family. The priest, elders, and guests shower the couple with flower petals to bless the couple for their journey into married life.

## Star Gazing
The bride and groom locate the pole star, ‘Dhruva’, in the sky as it symbolizes steadfastness. Then, they locate the star Arundhati (Alcor Star of the Ursa Major constellation) which symbolizes the wife of Sage Vashishta in Hindu mythology, who lead a glorious and virtuous life.
